# Exception Handling

### Created two different custom Exceptions:
- Atm Card Validation
- Driving License Validation

## ATM Card Validation
Checks if the user is valid or not. If user is valid, user can dispense cash, else user needs to try again. If the user has tried three times and every time user account details are wrong then the user's card will be blocked and reported. (Default account number is 1111 and pin code is 2222)

## Driving License Validation
Checks if the Applicant is valid for Driving License or not based on his age. If the applicant is valid, the license will be applied and goes for further processing, else user needs to try again. If the user has tried three times his account will be blocked and reported. (Valid age is more than or equal to 18 and less than 60)
